on Ubuntu when you install Nodejs some times it doesn't install the LTS version > for me the Nodejs version was only installing 10.xx.x
most of developers that using Nodejs on Linux will know how to fix this, but some new comers would have a trouble so I will post a way to install NVM(Node Version Manager)

after that we need to run the NVM installer

after that you will need to logout and login to load the environment
now we will install node using NVM

this is the command that install the latest version of node, and if you want you can specific version of node using

Using

this is the command that can find the installed versions of node

this is the command that can find to available nodejs versions

this is the command that can select a different version of node

you can also run this to find the default version of node of your system
