                src="/assets/images/{{page.id}}/property-pane.png" alt="Property adding screen" /></a>
<p>     
        After that you will see the area for put the website address
        enter that and you will see the tracking id (measurement id)
        and also the script file for adding it at the head part of the
        html of your page

<h3> If you are going to use the same theme with me</h3>
<p>
        at the _includes folder, you will see the analytics.html
        remove all and paste the google tag from the upper step
